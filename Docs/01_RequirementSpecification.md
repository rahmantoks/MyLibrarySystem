# 1.0 Introduction
## 1.1 Purpose 
The purpose of this document is to give a detailed description of My Library System. It will explain the features, the interfaces, what the system will do, and the constraints under which it must operate. This document is created for both stakeholder and the developer of the system. 

## 1.2 Scope of Project
This software system will be a Library Management System for a small library in my imaginary town of Moyudan. This system will be designed to streamline library operations, improving user experiences, and ensuring efficient resource management. It helps the library provide better services to their users while maintaining integrity of their collections.

More specifically, this system will be able to do the following:
1. Cataloging and Organization: This system will help the library efficiently catalog and organize their collections. It allows librarians to create detailed records for each item in the library, including books, journals, multimedia materials, and more. This cataloging process includes information such as titles, authors, publishers, publication dates, ISBNs, and more.
2. Inventory Management: This system will enable librarians to keep track of the library's inventory. It helps in monitoring the availability of items, managing check-outs and returns, and identifying lost or missing materials. This helps maintain the integrity of the library's collection.
3. User Management: This system will allow librarians to manage user accounts, including registration, authentication, and user data. It tracks the borrowing history of patrons, helping librarians to serve their needs better.
4. Circulation Control: This system will automate the circulation process, making it easier for library users to check out and return items. It also manages due dates and fines for overdue materials.
5. Search and Discovery: This system will make it easy for users to find materials in the library's collection. Users can search by title, author, subject, keyword, or other criteria.
6. Reservations and Holds: This system will allow users to reserve or place holds on items that are currently checked out. It will manage these requests and notifies users when the items become available.
7. Reporting and Analytics: This system will enable librarians to generate reports and analyze library data. This information helps in making informed decisions about collection development, resource allocation, and user services.
8.  Security and Privacy: This system will help maintaining the security of user data and library resources. It may include features like user authentication, role-based access control, and data encryption.
